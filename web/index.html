        This site is still under development. A lot of features have not been added, and some content is missing from
        the website. Please be patient as we roll out changes over the next couple of weeks.

                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">DNAnalyzer identifies proteins, amino acids, start and stop
                        codons, high coverage regions, regions susceptible to neurodevelopmental disorders,
                        transcription factors, and regulatory elements. Researchers are working to extract valuable
                        information from such software to better understand human health and disease. Currently, we have
                        a Command-Line-Interface (CLI) and are working on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will
                        enable physicians to quickly and more easily interact with the software, enabling them to
                        identify genetic mutations that may cause disease.</p>

                    <h2 class="primary-dark">Background</h2>
                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">The human genome is composed of over 3 billion base pairs,
                        making human analysis nearly impossible. Consequently, using powerful computational and
                        statistical methods to decode the functional information hidden in DNA sequences are
                        necessary. The genome is also extremely intricate and contains a plethora of data, which
                        need to be organized and converted into analyzable data appropriately. Current analytical
                        tools and software make it arduous for both geneticists and physicians to do so, thus
                        restricting them from acquiring crucial information to better understand humans.</p>
