                <h2 class="primary-dark">Brief Introduction  </h2>
                <p class="secondary-dark text-center">DNAnalyzer identifies proteins, amino acids, start and stop codons, high coverage regions, regions susceptible to neurodevelopment disorders, transcription factors, and regulatory elements. Researchers are working to extract valuable information from such software to better understand human health and disease. Currently, we are working on developing a Command-Line-Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will enable physicians to quickly and more easily interact with the software, enabling them to identify genetic mutations that may cause disease.</p>

                    <h2 class="primary-dark">Background </h2>
                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">The human genome is composed of over 3 billion base pairs, making human analysis nearly impossible. Consequently, using powerful computational and statistical methods to decode the functional information hidden in DNA sequences are necessary. The genome is also extremely intricate and contains a plethora of data, which need to be organized and converted into analyzable data appropriately. Current analytical tools and software make it arduous for both geneticists and physicians to do so, thus restricting them from acquiring crucial information to better understand humans.</p>

                  <p class="secondary-dark text-left">

&nbsp;  1.Start and stop codons <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Indicate the start and stop of an amino acid. There are 20 different amino acids. A protein consists of one or more<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chains of amino acids (called polypeptides) whose sequence is encoded in a gene.<br>
&nbsp;  2.High coverage regions <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Regions of a DNA genome that code for a protein and have a relatively high proportion of guanine and cytosine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nucleotides to the 4 nucleotide bases (45-60% GC-content).<br>
&nbsp;  3.Longest genes  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most susceptible to disease implications and are especially linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism).<br>
&nbsp;  4.Transcription factors <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proteins that help turn specific genes "on" or "off" by binding to nearby DNA. <br>
&nbsp;  5.Regulatory elements <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding sites for transcription factors, which are involved in gene regulation. <br>
&nbsp;  6.FASTA files (.fa) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supports multi-line and single-line FASTA database files. Files can either be uploaded or linked to from the web.  <br>
&nbsp;  7.Command-line interface (Met CLI)  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Methionine command-line interface (abbreviated as Met CLI) is a unified tool for running DNAnalyzer services<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the command-line. The CLI is a powerful tool for using DNAnalyzer services and scripting a sequence of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commands to execute. You can currently access all the core features present in DNAnalyzer without having to log &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in,although account  support will  be implemented soon. To get more information on Met CLI installation and <br>&emsp;&nbsp; currently supported commands,refer to Met CLI  GitHub repository.
