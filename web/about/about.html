                <h2 class="primary-dark">Piyush Acharya ( Lead Developer & Maintainer )</h2>

                <p class="secondary-dark text-center">Hi there! 👋 I'm Piyush, a freshman at Interlake High School
                    interested in SWE and ML. I'm highly passionate about exploring different ways in which I can
                    advance my skills in the branches of science while also tying it with my passion for computer
                    science.

                    Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I’ve witnessed the forefront of STEM and innovation on my
                    doorstep. This inspired my love for problem-solving and creating early on, from doing
                    competitive math/science to coding my first Python game.

                    I've competed in a variety of science tournaments, and I recently traveled to Washington, D.C.
                    to compete in the National Science Bowl hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy, where my team
                    and I won first place.

                    I am also committed to developing large-scale open source projects - I have created and
                    contributed to numerous projects on GitHub. When I'm not studying for upcoming competitions and
                    tests, you can usually find me at my computer, tinkering away at a bioinformatics algorithm I
                    invented for analyzing proteins in DNA.

                    In addition to my passion for science and technology, I'm deeply committed to giving back to my
                    community.

                    This is why I joined Mighty Crayon 2 years ago, with the mission of encouraging enjoyable and
                    empowering experiences for children around the world through the use of recycled creative
                    mediums. Today, as the Co-Executive Director, I have set a goal to deliver 100,000+ crayons and
                    educational coloring books to children in need around the world by the end of 2023.

                    Additionally, I am a Curriculum Developer Intern at the Nuevo Foundation, where I develop
                    curricula for underprivileged students, including interactive courses for Python, Linux, EV3,
                    cybersecurity, and other topics pertaining to technology.

                    In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, tennis, swimming, and exploring the extensive
                    Redmond trail system near my home either with my family or my DJI Mavic 3.</p>
