# Enhanced User Experience Features

DNAnalyzer v1.2.1+ includes significant user experience improvements that make the tool much more accessible and organized. This guide covers all the new features designed to make your DNA analysis workflow smoother and more intuitive.

## üìÅ Organized Output Management

### Automatic Directory Structure

Starting with v1.2.1, DNAnalyzer automatically creates an organized directory structure for all output files:

```
output/dnanalyzer_output_{filename}_{timestamp}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ charts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {filename}_qc_chart.png          # Base composition charts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sequences/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mutations_{timestamp}.fa         # Generated mutation sequences
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {filename}_report.html           # Future HTML reports
```

### Key Benefits:
- **No more scattered files** - Everything in one organized location
- **Clear naming conventions** - Easy to identify file types and purposes
- **Timestamped sessions** - Multiple analyses don't overwrite each other
- **Automatic cleanup** - Related files grouped together

### File Summary Output

After each analysis, DNAnalyzer provides a comprehensive summary of all generated files:

```
üìÅ Generated Files Summary
==========================
Output directory: /absolute/path/to/output/dnanalyzer_output_test_20250608_184523

üìÇ Quality Control:
   ‚úì Base composition and quality metrics chart
     üìÑ /absolute/path/to/charts/test.fa_qc_chart.png
     üìä Size: 15.2 KB

üìÇ Sequence Analysis:
   ‚úì Generated 3 mutations of the input sequence
     üìÑ /absolute/path/to/sequences/mutations_20250608_184523.fa
     üìä Size: 3.4 KB

üí° Tip: You can find all output files in the directory above.
   Open PNG files to view charts, and FA files contain DNA sequences.
```

## üöÄ Easy Launch Script

### Simple Preset Modes

The `easy_dna.sh` script provides intuitive preset modes instead of complex command-line flags:

```bash
# Basic analysis (default)
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa basic

# Comprehensive analysis with verbose output
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa detailed

# Fast analysis with minimal output
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa quick

# Generate mutations
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa mutations

# Reverse complement analysis
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa reverse

# Run all analysis types
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa all

# Interactive custom mode
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa custom
```

> The launcher checks `build/libs/` for a feature-complete DNAnalyzer jar, otherwise it falls back to
> `./gradlew run`. Advanced presets (detailed/quick/mutations/reverse/all/custom) are only available when
> those CLI flags are supported by the runtime. Build a fresh jar with `./gradlew jar` or set
> `DNANALYZER_JAR=/path/to/dnanalyzer.jar` to point at your preferred binary.

### Interactive Custom Mode

The custom mode asks simple yes/no questions instead of requiring command-line expertise:

```bash
./easy_dna.sh your_file.fa custom

# Prompts:
# Detailed analysis? (y/n): y
# Verbose output? (y/n): y  
# Generate mutations? (y/n): n
# Reverse complement? (y/n): n
```

### Help and Examples

Running the script without arguments shows usage information and examples:

```bash
./easy_dna.sh

# Shows:
# - Available sample files
# - All preset modes
# - Usage examples
# - Command-line options
```

## üéØ Analysis Profiles

### Predefined Workflow Profiles

Instead of memorizing command-line flags, use predefined profiles for common workflows:

```bash
# Research-grade analysis
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile research your_file.fa

# Clinical-grade analysis  
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile clinical your_file.fa

# Basic analysis
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile basic your_file.fa

# Detailed analysis
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile detailed your_file.fa

# Quick analysis
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile quick your_file.fa

# Mutation-focused analysis
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile mutation your_file.fa
```

### Profile Descriptions

| Profile | Description | Features |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `basic` | Standard analysis with core features | Standard output, basic charts |
| `detailed` | Comprehensive analysis with verbose output | Detailed statistics, verbose logging |
| `quick` | Fast analysis with minimal output | Essential results only |
| `research` | Research-grade analysis with all features | All analysis features enabled |
| `mutation` | Basic analysis with mutation generation | Includes 5 random mutations |
| `clinical` | Clinical-grade analysis for medical applications | Detailed output suitable for medical review |

### Listing Available Profiles

```bash
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile list
```

Running `--profile list` prints the preset names so you can discover every workflow from the terminal.
## üìä Enhanced File Notifications

### Real-time Progress Updates

DNAnalyzer now provides clear notifications as files are generated:

```bash
Reading DNA: Test DNA Sequence
=== QC Summary ===
GC Content: 50.09%
üìä Quality control chart generated: /path/to/output/charts/test.fa_qc_chart.png

Mutating DNA sequence...
üß™ Mutations written to: /path/to/output/sequences/mutations_20250608_184523.fa
```

### File Size Information

All generated files include size information in the final summary:

- Human-readable formats (KB, MB, GB)
- Helps users understand output file sizes
- Useful for storage planning and file sharing

## üîß Technical Implementation

### OutputManager Class

The new `OutputManager` class handles:
- Directory structure creation
- File path generation
- File tracking and registration
- Summary generation

### Backward Compatibility

All new features are backward compatible:
- Existing command-line options still work
- Old scripts and automation continue functioning
- Optional features don't interfere with existing workflows

### Error Handling

Enhanced error handling includes:
- Clear error messages with suggestions
- Graceful fallbacks when directory creation fails
- User-friendly guidance for common issues

## üìù Migration Guide

### From Previous Versions

If you're upgrading from an earlier version:

1. **Files now organized differently**: Look for outputs in the `output/` directory
2. **New script available**: Try `./easy_dna.sh` for simplified usage
3. **Profiles replace complex flags**: Use `--profile` instead of multiple options
4. **Enhanced notifications**: You'll see more detailed file information

### Script Migration

**Old way (complex):**
```bash
java -jar DNAnalyzer.jar --detailed --verbose --mutate=5 --gc-window=50 file.fa
```

**New way (simple):**
```bash
./easy_dna.sh file.fa detailed
# or
java -jar build/libs/DNAnalyzer-1.2.1.jar --profile research file.fa
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Custom Output Directories

While DNAnalyzer automatically creates organized directories, you can still customize behavior by modifying the `OutputManager` class or using symbolic links to redirect output locations.

### Automation and Scripting

The easy launch script and profiles make DNAnalyzer much more suitable for automation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Process multiple files with consistent settings
for file in *.fa; do
    ./easy_dna.sh "$file" research
done
```

### Integration with Workflows

The organized output structure makes it easy to integrate DNAnalyzer into larger bioinformatics pipelines:

```bash
# Run analysis
./easy_dna.sh sample.fa detailed

# Process outputs
convert output/*/charts/*.png output/combined_charts.pdf
cat output/*/sequences/*.fa > output/all_mutations.fa
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Output directory not created:**
- Check write permissions in the current directory
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try running with elevated permissions if necessary

**Easy script not found:**
- Ensure you're in the DNAnalyzer root directory
- Make the script executable: `chmod +x easy_dna.sh`
- Try running with `bash easy_dna.sh` directly

**Profile not recognized:**
- Use `--profile list --help` to see available profiles
- Check spelling and use lowercase profile names
- Ensure you're using DNAnalyzer v1.2.1 or later
